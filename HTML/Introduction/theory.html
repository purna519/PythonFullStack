    HTML Theory
    ==========

    HTML 
    1. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
    2. HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
    3. HTML describes the structure of a web page using markup.

    HTML History :
    - It was first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.
    - It was first implemented in 1991.

    HTML versions
    1. HTML 1.0 - The first version of HTML, released in 1993.
    2. HTML 2.0 - Released in 1995, it included support for forms and tables.
    3. HTML 3.0 - Released in 1997, it added support for applets and text flow around images.
    4. HTML 4.0 - Released in 1999, it introduced support for scripting languages and improved accessibility.
    5. HTML 5.0 - The latest version, released in 2014, includes new features like audio/video support, semantic elements, and APIs for web applications.

    HTML Structure
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>

    Why we use meta tags in HTML header ?
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    Tells the browser how to read characters. UTF-8 supports most languages and symbols.
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    Sets the viewport to control layout on mobile browsers, ensuring the page is responsive.(Like Mobile Applications)
    <meta name="description" content="A brief description of the page.">
    Provides a summary of the page's content for search engines and social media.
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
    Lists keywords relevant to the page, helping with search engine optimization (SEO).
    <meta name="author" content="Your Name">
    Specifies the author of the page, useful for attribution and copyright.

    webPage vs webSite vs webApplication
    1. A web page is a single document on the internet, typically written in HTML.
    2. A website is a collection of related web pages, usually identified by a common domain name.
    3. A web application is a software application that runs on a web server and can be accessed through a web browser, often providing interactive features.

    Naming conventions of a webpage and fileNames :
    Don't use this :
        page1.html
        page2.html
        page3.html
        page4.html
            
        - do not start the file name with a number.
        - do not use a space in the file name.
        - do not use a special character in the file name.
        - do not use predfined keywords from the langauge as filenames

    Do's :
    
        - use all lowercase letters
        - use hyphens instead of spaces
        - use underscores instead of spaces
        - use camel case instead of spaces
        - use a descriptive name

    HTML5 featuers :
    - semantic elements *
        The term “semantic” refers to the meaning of the text.
        For instance, using the <div> tag doesn’t suggest the content it will carry, however using the <p> tag suggests it can be used to hold paragraph information.
            ex : aside,article,section,header,footer....
    - canvas and svg
        Canvas elements, you can easily draw graphics using JavaScript. It is optimum for creating simple animations and drawing photo compositions.
        To initialize the Canvas element <canvas> tag is used with only two specific attributes, width and height. Once, the element is initialized, it is then taken care of with the help of JavaScript to draw shapes, lines, images, and more.
    - video and audio *
        HTML5 has reduced the hassle of relying upon third-party services such as Adobe Flash player. To embed Audio and Video into your HTML document, you may use the following two tags, <audio> and <video> tags.
    - web storage *
        storing data locally and securely within a user’s browser.
        types: Session and local storage are the two main types of web storage. 
            - whatever gets stored in the window.sessionStorage object will not disappear on a reload of the web page. Instead, the computer will delete the stored data only when users close the browser tab or window.
            - whatever gets stored in the window.localStorage object will not disappear during a reload or reopening of the web page or when users close their browsers. Those data have no expiration time. 
    - geo location *
        The Geolocation API is an HTML feature that is used to access the geographical position of a user, however, it is not accessed unless the user approves of it.
    - web workers
        web workers were added to HTML 5 to allow scripts to operate in the background without interfering with the UI thread.
    - web sockets
        HTML 5 we can establish a bidirectional live communication between the server and the client (a web browser) to reduce the latency in the responses.
    - offline web apps
        An offline web app is a web application that continues to function even without an internet connection.
    - form enhancements *
        HTML 5 include new input times such as email, URL, and more, placeholder text, required fields feature, validation, and more.
