    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    Sets the viewport to control layout on mobile browsers, ensuring the page is responsive.(Like Mobile Applications)
    <meta name="description" content="A brief description of the page.">
    Provides a summary of the page's content for search engines and social media.
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
    Lists keywords relevant to the page, helping with search engine optimization (SEO).
    <meta name="author" content="Your Name">
    Specifies the author of the page, useful for attribution and copyright.
